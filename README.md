# python-subprocess-thread-example
An example of using the python subprocess module with a timeout

# WHY?
This is really only here for my own reference from research that I've been doing in my spare time.  This code was created after looking for examples online about how to use the subprocess module on python 2.7.x without trying to use the backported subprocess implementation from python 3.x.

This could was cobbled together from different sources that I found on-line and it seems to work.  If this becomes something I'll re-use I'll make this more official.

Here are the links that I used to create this code:
